## Who am I (professionally)?

* Non-tenure-track Assistant Professor of Statistics and Data Science at Macalester College, a small liberal arts college in St. Paul, MN USA.  

* I have been teaching here for 4 years (and am also an alum!), but I also have experience in industry working as a statistician and data scientist. 

* This year, I created a new course called "Advanced Data Science in R", and that's what I'll be talking about.

## Course learning objectives

* Make using git and GitHub a habit. 
* Create a website.  
* Become familiar with more machine learning models and methods and the associated R code.  
* Gain confidence in learning new R functions on your own and experience teaching others to use them.  
* Understand what it means to "put a model into production".  
* Create a shiny app to interact with a model.  
* Appreciate the importance of data ethics/justice and integrate it into all aspects of data science.  
* Practice working in a group to achieve a shared goal.

## Course logistics

* Mostly online using Zoom. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 11AM-1PM for 7.5 weeks. 
* Course material was posted to the course website. Students were expected to read through that on their own.  
* Monday classes were for working through weekly exercises.  
* Wednesday classes had a speaker from industry for 1 hour and 1 hour was for working through weekly exercises.  
* Fridays were group presentations by students, where they taught the rest of the class about an R package or set of related functions. Topics included {tidytext}, {sf}, regular expressions, and more.  The groups also created a small set of exercises for the rest of the students.    
* The last three weeks of class were reserved for working on a class project.

## What went well?

* Students became more comfortable with Git and Github.  
* They used it for each of their assignments, providing a link to the repo each time.  
* Ok success on group projects, but still pretty basic. They were all collaborators on the project. In general, they didn't use branches or make pull requests.  
* I need to teach this directly.
