## Who am I (professionally)?

* Non-tenure-track Assistant Professor of Statistics and Data Science at Macalester College, a small liberal arts college in St. Paul, MN USA.  

* I have been teaching here for 4 years (and am also an alum!), but I also have experience in industry working as a statistician and data scientist. 

* This year, I created a new course called "Advanced Data Science in R", and that's what I'll be talking about.

## Course learning objectives

* Make using git and GitHub a habit. 
* Create a website.  
* Become familiar with more machine learning models and methods and the associated R code.  
* Gain confidence in learning new R functions on your own and experience teaching others to use them.  
* Understand what it means to "put a model into production".  
* Appreciate the importance of data ethics/justice and integrate it into all aspects of data science.  
* Practice working in a group to achieve a shared goal.

## Course logistics

* Mostly online using Zoom. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 11AM-1PM for 7.5 weeks. 
* Course material was posted to the course website. Students were expected to read through that on their own.  
* Monday classes were for working through weekly exercises.  
* Wednesday classes had a speaker from industry for 1 hour and 1 hour was for working through weekly exercises.  
* Fridays were group presentations by students, where they taught the rest of the class about an R package or set of related functions. Topics included {tidytext}, {sf}, regular expressions, and more.  The groups also created a small set of exercises for the rest of the students.    
* The last three weeks of class were reserved for working on a class project.

## Successes and Failures

* Next, I will talk about successes and failures within each course learning objective.  
* I'll end by discussing successes and failures that were unrelated to the course learning objectives.

## Git/Github


.pull-left[
**Successes**

* Students became more comfortable with Git and Github.  
* They used it for each of their assignments, providing a link to the repo each time.  
* They were all collaborators on the group project.

]

.pull-right[
**Failures**

* In general, they didn't use branches or make pull requests. This is likely because I didn't require that they do it.

## Create a website

.pull-left[
**Successes**
* They all created websites!  
* A few of them made really impressive websites.  
* They listed to a reflected on Jacueline Nolis and Emily Robinson's *Build a Career in Data Science* podcast episode that discussed making websites. 
]

.pull-right[
**Failures**
* Many were VERY basic, using defaults except changing their names. But, I didn't require anything more.  
* Most of them didn't choose to post anything on them. Again, I didn't require this.

## Machine Learning methods

.pull-left[
**Successes**
* Learned {tidymodels}, stacking/ensembling, interpreteble machine learning methods, boosting, and using H20 in R. 
]

.pull-right[
**Failures**
* Learning {tidymodels} wasn't as much of a review as I thought it would be. Since they weren't used to this framework, they had a tough time with the code at first.  
* We didn't have time for deep learning.  
*

## Learning on their own and teaching others
      
.pull-left[
**Successes**
* Every student helped teach a new package or set of functions to the class. 
* Students did a lot of problem solving on their own, without my help, to prepare their materials.  
]

.pull-right[
**Failures**
* I should check in with the group before their presentation to assure the topic covers the right amount of material and to make sure the code is up-to-date. Some groups used older code, which could be confusing when searching the internet for how to expand it.

## Put a model into production

      
.pull-left[
**Successes**
* Students saved a model they created using the `saveRDS()` function.  
* They used the saved model in a shiny app.  
]

.pull-right[
**Failures**
* These two steps helped introduce the idea of putting a model into production, but they were still missing a lot of steps.  
* In the future, I would like to discuss using Docker and the {plumber} R package to more closely resemble what it's like to put a model in production.

## Importance of data ethics/justice

      
.pull-left[
**Successes**
* There was a reading/viewing exercise on each homework assignment about data ethics/justice. Examples included watching *Coded Bias* and reading Deb Raji's Tweet thread about popular misconceptions people have about race and gender bias in algorithms.  
* Student reflected on what they watched/read.
]

.pull-right[
**Failures**
* We should discuss this as a group or even watch/read as a group.  
* Create more reflection questions within the assignment where they are working through the machine learning problems.

## Working in a group to achieve a shared goal

      
.pull-left[
**Successes**

* Students usually worked on weekly assignments together.  
* They

## Other things that went well

* The students enjoyed having the speakers every week. It gave them many different perspectives on work as a data scientist.

## What didn't go well? (controllable)

---

## What didn't go well? (no control)

* The 7.5 week module, rather than a 15 week semester felt too condensed.  
* Students wanted more illustrations from me. I could highlight an example or two in class rather than having them move right into working on assignments.  
* They needed more time for their projects. They didn't have time to make mistakes and start over or to change topics.  
* SO MUCH more I wanted to cover and in SO MUCH more detail. It might be better to skip some topics or try to incorporate some into their machine learning course. For example, if they learned {tidymodels} in that course, I could jump right into stacking/ensembling in this course.
